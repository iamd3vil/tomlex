# Tomlex [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zamith/tomlex.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/zamith/tomlex) [![Inline docs](http://inch-ci.org/github/zamith/tomlex.svg?branch=master)](http://inch-ci.org/github/zamith/tomlex)

A TOML parser for elixir.

## Getting Started

You can read all about the TOML markup language in the [official github repo](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml).

### Requirements

* Elixir v1.0.0+

### Usage

Add tomlex as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file.

``` elixir
defp deps do
  [{:tomlex, ">= 0.0.0"}]
end
```

Alternatively you can get the edge version.

``` elixir
defp deps do
  [{:tomlex, git: "https://github.com/zamith/tomlex.git"}]
end
```

After you're done, run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch the dependencies.

Tomlex gets a string and parses it into an elixir `Map` using the `load`
function.

``` elixir
defmodule YourApp do
  def your_function do
    parsed_file = File.read!("path/to/file.toml") |> Tomlex.load
  end
end
```

*Notice:* Do not use different data types in the same array. Tomlex allows it
for now, but will disallow it in the future, as per the [TOML specs](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#array).

### Documentation

You can find more documentation [here](http://hexdocs.pm/tomlex/).
